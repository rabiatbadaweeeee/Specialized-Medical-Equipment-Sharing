# Decentralized Specialized Medical Equipment Sharing

A blockchain-powered platform enabling secure, verified sharing of specialized medical equipment among patients, healthcare providers, and medical facilities to improve access, reduce costs, and extend the utility of valuable healthcare resources.

## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of specialized medical equipment accessibility and affordability through a decentralized sharing economy approach. By creating a transparent, secure system for registering, matching, sanitizing, and training users on specialized medical devices, the platform ensures that valuable equipment doesn't sit unused while patients who need it go without.

The system uses smart contracts to enforce medical-grade safety standards while maximizing the utility and accessibility of specialized equipment that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive for individual patients or smaller healthcare facilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Equipment Registration Contract

Records and verifies specialized medical equipment available for sharing:
- Device specifications and capabilities
- Regulatory approvals and compliance status
- Ownership verification and lending terms
- Availability schedule and location
- Maintenance history and operational status
- Required training level for usage

### 2. Patient Matching Contract

Connects available equipment with qualified patients in need:
- Patient needs assessment and equipment matching
- Prescription/medical necessity verification
- Proximity-based matching to minimize transport
- Waitlist management for high-demand equipment
- Priority allocation for urgent medical needs
- Usage duration tracking and extension requests

### 3. Sanitization Verification Contract

Ensures proper cleaning and sterilization between users:
- Equipment-specific sanitization protocols
- Sanitization verification by qualified personnel
- Documentation of cleaning procedures completed
- Chain of custody tracking between users
- Infection control compliance verification
- Quarantine management for specific contamination risks

### 4. Training Contract

Verifies users have proper knowledge for equipment operation:
- Equipment-specific training modules
- Certification tracking for patients and caregivers
- Healthcare provider verification of competency
- Remote training session coordination
- Refresher training scheduling
- Emergency use protocols

## Benefits

- **For Patients**: Increases access to specialized equipment, reduces waiting times, lowers costs, and improves health outcomes
- **For Healthcare Providers**: Maximizes equipment utilization, reduces capital expenditures, expands treatment options, and improves patient compliance
- **For Equipment Manufacturers**: Creates new business models, extends product lifecycles, and provides usage analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List technical prerequisites]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-equipment-sharing.git

# Install dependencies
cd medical-equipment-sharing
npm install
```

npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering Medical Equipment
```javascript
// Example code for equipment registration
const equipmentRegistry = await EquipmentRegistry.deploy();
await equipmentRegistry.registerEquipment(
  "0x123...", // Equipment owner address
  "Portable Ventilator", // Equipment type
  "Model XYZ-100", // Equipment model
  "FDA123456", // Regulatory approval number
  maintenanceHistory, // Maintenance records hash
  sanitizationProtocolId, // Required sanitization protocol
  trainingRequirementLevel // Required user training
);
```

### Creating a Patient-Equipment Match
```javascript
// Example code for patient matching
const patientMatcher = await PatientMatcher.deploy();
const matchId = await patientMatcher.createMatch(
  patientId,
  equipmentId,
  prescriptionHash,
  requestedDuration,
  priorityLevel,
  specialRequirements
);
```

## Medical Safety Features

- **Compliance verification**: Ensures all equipment meets regulatory standards
- **Sanitization enforcement**: Prevents usage without verified sanitization
- **Training requirements**: Matches user certification to equipment complexity
- **Medical necessity verification**: Requires prescription or provider authorization
- **Emergency access protocols**: Expedited process for urgent medical needs

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial platform development and regulatory compliance structure
- **Q3 2025**: Pilot program with select healthcare providers and patient groups
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with existing healthcare IT systems
- **Q1 2026**: Expansion to additional equipment categories and geographical regions

## Stakeholder Ecosystem
